**Full-stack software solution for electronics industry management.**  

Developed as a team project at Politecnico di Torino, EZElectronics is an end-to-end platform designed to help managers of electronics stores manage products, offer them to customers, and track sales through a dedicated website. Managers can assess and update products, process orders, and view purchase history. Customers can browse products, add items to a cart, and view their past purchases.  
My main contributions focused on backend architecture, API design, and deployment using **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Docker**, ensuring a robust and maintainable system.
