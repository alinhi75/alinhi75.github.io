Currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, I specialize in backend development, scalable software architecture, and system programming. My experience spans full-stack engineering, with a focus on PHP/Laravel, Node.js, TypeScript, Vue, and React, complemented by a solid foundation in DevOps and low-level programming.

As a Backend Developer at PlusYar, I design and maintain robust APIs and backend services, ensuring scalability, security, and high performance for a global user base. I’m passionate about building clean, maintainable, and future-proof solutions that power impactful, user-centric platforms.

I thrive on tackling complex engineering challenges—from architecting backend infrastructures to streamlining deployment pipelines. Always eager to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and contribute to innovative projects in modern software development.
